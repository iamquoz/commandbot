# commandbot
an hour worth of work on this bot

to add a command for bot to use

`.add "command name" "link to an image"`

to replace the link for a given command 

`.add "command name" "link to a new image"`

to display an image

`."command name"`

(no quote marks everywhere)

**before launching the bot, make sure there's an empty file called commands.json in the directory, it'll store all the commands added via .add and in case of a shut down, all commands will be resored**
